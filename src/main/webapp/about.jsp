<h1>What about us ?</h1>

<p>Welcome to our crowdfunder website. This project is coming from a school project, it seems to start so good that we decided to build this as a real website.</p>

<p>It's working exactly like other websites, so you know the rules, feel free to help any projects</p>

<p>Here you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Register if you are not</li>
	<li>Create a new project on your own</li>
	<li>Donate for a project that you love</li>
	<li>And keep smiling every day !</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you very much</p>
